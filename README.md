# PygameBossFightGame
Small pygame project I made in my first year of university. The game is made in python with pygame. The game uses the packages, pygame, math, random and functools. 

On Linux devices:
The game can be run by executing the file "main" inside the dist folder.

Other devices:
The game can be run by executing the file "main.py" inside the src folder with the packages installed.
